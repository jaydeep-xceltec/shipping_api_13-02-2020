     Very simple application using Node.js, Knex- SQL query builder
    

       Workflow:
    1. Create a HTTP API for writing to the database
    2. Create some HTML and JS to POST to the API
    3. Use Knex migrations to create a user database schema (a similar process to Rails migrations)
    4. Use a migration to setup password hashing
    5. Create a login route to check the hashing works
